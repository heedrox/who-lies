Voy a corregir el JSON inválido eliminando la expresión JavaScript y usando una ruta absoluta a `npx` de Node 20, coherente con tu uso de nvm [[memory:6322958]].

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering code changes**

I see that after any substantial code edit or schema change, I should run tests or a build. However, I might not have those tests in place. I can use the read_lints tool to check things instead. This tool returns diagnostics for files in the workspace, but I'm wondering if it can handle external file paths. It accepts both relative and absolute paths, so I'll run read_lints with that file path after I edit. Then, I can execute apply_patch!</details></think>

Voy a actualizar el archivo para eliminar la concatenación JavaScript y usar la ruta absoluta de `npx` de Node 20, manteniendo el JSON válido. Luego verificaré que no queden errores de lint.

### Solución breve
El problema es que JSON no permite expresiones JavaScript como `+ process.env.PATH`. Reemplacé eso por una configuración válida apuntando a `npx` de Node 20.

Cambios clave:
- `command` ahora apunta a `"/Users/jordimarti/.nvm/versions/node/v20.18.3/bin/npx"`.
- Eliminé el bloque `env` inválido.

Ahora el JSON es válido y el linter no marca errores.

- **Qué hice**: Edité `/Users/jordimarti/.cursor/mcp.json` para quitar la concatenación JS y usar ruta absoluta a `npx`. Verifiqué que no hay errores de lint.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Assessing Node and JSON compatibility**

I'm thinking about `npx` and how it usually works with the same Node installation. If it's using system Node 14, that could complicate things. On Mac, `npx` might have been installed with corepack alongside Node 20. I want to set the environment PATH to include the Node v20 bin, but JSON can't use JavaScript expressions directly. It seems like MCP might not support variable expansion either, so I'll need to find a way to configure PATH correctly within JSON limits.
**Configuring dynamic PATH settings**

I’m considering how to set the PATH dynamically for my application. Since I can’t know the user's exact PATH at runtime, I can create a string with the current PATH and include a default value. Using a common mechanism, I can set the `command` to `env`, which should allow PATH to work correctly. Alternatively, I could wrap the command in a login shell like `zsh` or `bash`, but I want to ensure that it operates within the `.cursor/mcp.json` constraints. Setting the PATH as the Node 20 bin plus the existing one seems like a safer option.
**Setting PATH for Node20**

I'm figuring out how to set the PATH for Node20 without variable expansion. Since the user wants to avoid errors, I can combine the Node20 bin with a standard macOS PATH. It's crucial to ensure that we run `nvm use 20` before executing commands, but since this is for an MCP server, I can't use interactive commands. I'll update the `.cursor/mcp.json` with the new PATH and possibly include a "node" environment variable, even though it's often unnecessary. Setting the correct PATH should ensure that both Node and npx use Node20 effectively.
**Updating MCP server configuration**

I'm preparing to update the configuration file for the MCP server. I'll set the command for npx, including a properly configured PATH with the Node20 bin and additional paths. Since the user's environment might contain Homebrew paths, I’ll add that in before the others for better compatibility. Another option is to reference the Node binary directly, but using npx seems acceptable given that the MCP server is a package. I'll include a status update and then implement the changes while confirming the file's line count afterwards.
**Planning file update steps**

I’m thinking about the next steps for updating the file. First, I’ll read the file and then apply the necessary patch. I need to remember to include a status update before making any tool calls. It’s also crucial that I respond to the user in Spanish, keeping my response concise. I’ll summarize my findings in bullet points to make it clear and easy to understand. Let’s move forward with this plan!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing Node 20 path**

I’m setting up the environment PATH string to include both the Node 20 bin and the standard path. It’s crucial to format this correctly in JSON, ensuring there are no trailing commas and keeping the indentation at two spaces.

I have to remember to run `nvm use 20` before executing commands, and when referencing memory, I need to include the memory ID like this: "siguiendo tu configuración con nvm [[memory:6322958]]". I’ll make sure to proceed carefully!
**Applying the patch**

I need to keep formatting minimal, so bullet points and short summaries are acceptable. First, I’ll prepare the patch by adding the `env` object to the existing file content. 

The current structure includes the `mcpServers`, and I’ll insert the environment variables right between the command and args, ensuring to keep a two-space indentation level.

There’s also a thought about possibly changing the command back to "npx" for reliance on PATH, but it’s ultimately fine to maintain the absolute path for consistency. I just need to remember to perform the micro-update first and then apply the lints. Let's get started!</details></think>

Voy a añadir `env.PATH` con la carpeta `bin` de Node 20 al principio y rutas estándar de macOS, manteniendo `npx` fijo a Node 20, para evitar que se resuelva a Node 14. Luego revisaré el lint del archivo.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Confirming PATH changes**

I need to ensure that the PATH includes Node 20's bin, but I can't merge or expand it in the typical way. The child's PATH uses the exact string provided. We set a set of reasonable system paths, and the user wanted a certain PATH set, so we did that. Now, it's time to confirm if this resolves the error. I could suggest the user test it or propose a command to run using the terminal. We need a status update first.
**Testing Node version**

We're not inside the user's Cursor environment, but I can run commands from their system to check the Node version. I propose running a test with commands like echo PATH, which node, and node -v. I also need to ensure that env.PATH includes both the Node 20 bin and the user's existing PATH. Since we can't pull their specific PATH from a static file, our defaults should be sufficient. However, there might be conflicts if their PATH includes other directories like conda. It's essential to prioritize Node 20/bin.
**Crafting a concise message**

I need to create a clear Spanish message explaining that I've added `env.PATH` to prioritize the Node 20 bin and common binaries, which should fix the mismatch error. I’ll ask the user to retry. There's also an optional alternative where they could run `npx` via `--yes`, but it seems unnecessary. Since the user wants to establish the path, I should show the specific JSON snippet, even though the guideline suggests avoiding code unless asked. Including a small code block citing lines and path is acceptable, so I’ll do that.
**Preparing code block and updates**

I plan to show the relevant code block with lines 3-6 from the mcpServers section, as I need to include at least one line. I’ve noted my file has lines numbered 1 to 8, so I’ll cite those accordingly in the special code block format that lists startLine:endLine:filepath and the content.

However, I'll need to comply with the status update specification. In this message, we haven't run any new tool calls, but previously I did use apply_patch and read_lints, so that should be accounted for.
**Confirming JSON and PATH**

A new message from the user has come in, and while we might not need to run any tools, it’s wise to confirm the final JSON and propose verification commands. I need to communicate that we've added `env.PATH` and show the specific lines that were changed. I'll provide instructions for the user to retry. Since we’re responding in Spanish, I'll reference nvm usage regarding Node 20 and use markdown formatting with headings and bold text. It’s essential to summarize at the end, and I plan to read the file again to ensure accurate line numbers since it has likely increased from our last edits. Let's get started!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing command discrepancies**

I see that the last read file indicates the command reverted to "npx." This seems inconsistent because the previous patch updated the command to an absolute path. So, could it be that a concurrent edit changed it or the patch was overwritten? The open file still shows 11 lines, while I expected only 8. The user insists on setting the PATH, which we've done, but we need to ensure "npx" is correctly found. Fixing this seems straightforward!
**Addressing terminal errors**

The terminal error arose because the absolute path to npx was used with PATH not set correctly. In the MCP server config, we've set the env PATH, which is a relief. The user likely wants a quick and concise fix. We need to confirm that the JSON env PATH shouldn't have concatenations and should include the Node 20 bin plus standard paths. I can provide a command to test which node is used by npx based on the PATH. Additionally, I’ll mention the use of "env" in JSON for setting PATH. Let's also prepare the final JSON snippet!
**Clarifying rules and best practices**

The rule states that only relevant sections should be formatted, so we can show a small snippet while keeping verbosity minimal. I need to ensure I didn't violate the indent style; the file uses two spaces, which our apply_patch preserved. Also, there's the note about using "nvm use 20" before running commands since we don’t run terminal commands directly. If we discuss commands, we should include reminders about memory. As for tools, we won't be using them in this response, so no need for a micro-update.
**Confirming file content**

I need to confirm that the final file content sets the PATH and has "command": "npx." Earlier, we had it as an absolute path, but now it's just "npx." I believe this works since PATH includes Node 20's bin first, meaning calling "npx" should pick Node 20’s version. We might think about adding a NODE environment variable, but maybe that’s not necessary. I’ll explain briefly that we need to fix PATH and update the user, providing snippet lines L4-L8 using the citing_code method to confirm. The file shows 11 lines, but we'll focus on lines 4-8 for clarity.
**Responding to user about npx**

I need to confirm that the issue arises because `npx` and its child processes pick `node` from the PATH. The fix involves adding `env.PATH` in mcp.json to prioritize the Node 20 bin, which we've already done. If the user prefers the absolute command path to "/Users/.../bin/npx," that's optional since with PATH it's working fine. I should suggest re-running the process and reassure them that it should work now. I’ll acknowledge their concerns in Spanish: "He puesto PATH en el archivo; vuelve a intentarlo," and provide the relevant code snippet.</details></think>

Tienes razón: `npx` y los procesos hijos toman `node` del PATH. Ya dejé Node 20 al frente del `PATH` en el archivo, por lo que usará `node`/`npm` v20.

```4:8:/Users/jordimarti/.cursor/mcp.json
      "command": "npx",
      "env": {
        "PATH": "/Users/jordimarti/.nvm/versions/node/v20.18.3/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin"
      },
      "args": [ "@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server" ]
```

- **Qué cambiar**: Nada más; con ese `PATH` ya no caerá en Node 14.
- **Probar**: Cierra y reabre Cursor (o recarga MCP) y vuelve a lanzar el servidor MCP. Si lo ejecutas manualmente en terminal, haz antes `nvm use 20`.
